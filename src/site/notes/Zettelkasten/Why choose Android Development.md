## Why choose Android Development

### Larges smartphone market~
Android owns the first place when talking about market share worldwide, developing an Android app can potentially lead to greater user adoption

### Integration with Google services
Android is well-integrated with GoogleServices, which can unlock powerful cloud features and interact with the user google account.

### Versatility 

You can build apps for Phones, Watches, Tablets,TV's  and even Smart home devices with the same code-base. This allows you to create apps for a whole ecosystem.
### Open-source~
Android is open source, which can help to build trust in the platform.

## Why not to choose Android development?

### Fragmented ecosystem
Being the largest smartphone market has his drawbacks, and is that the testing of you apps has to be done with a wide range of devices, all with different specs. Which can lead to unexpected bugs and larger development time and debugging.
#### Lacking ecosystem
In my experience the Android Ecosystem is not that big when talking about libraries that solve issues.
#### Libraries for basic things
One of the things that I don't like about Android development is that for example to develop a jetpack compose app with basic navigation you need to add tons of Jetpack's libraries for: jetpack compose, navigation, material design, material design-compose all of them with different versions. In my opinion this should come with the Core library and it just adds more friction to build an app.

### High Learning Curve
Android development can be complex. It will take time to become proficient in Android development and understand all the components of the platform
### Constant deprecations
The Android ecosystem tends to have more breaking changes than iOS or the Web, which leads to constant refactors and OS checks.

### Competitive market
By being the most accessible platform this leads to a more competitive environment as there's more people able to develop an app with a low entry brarrier.
