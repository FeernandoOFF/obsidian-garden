## Reasons to choose web development

> TL;DR I'd recommend Web development to all the people who is always willing to **build stuff** and share it. Or if you're not a technical guy and you're trying to **prototype an idea.**

--
### Instant results & Share progress

One of the engaging things that I've found  of web development is that you'll see immediate results, as **everyone has a browser** in their device. So you'll be able to **see and share** your work in a easy way, which makes it more engaging

--
### Community and packages

Another thing that I've found in my path as a web developer is that the community is **huge** and there's a lot of resources to learn, practice and copy. I've found this beneficial as it makes me engage more and be able to create cool things without having to understand fully at the beginning.

--
### Versatility 

Similar to the last two points, the [[Zettelkasten/Javascript Ecosystem\|Javascript Ecosystem]] is huge, and has reach a point where you can create [[Multiplatform Development\|multiplatform apps]] so you're not just restrained into a browser, so once you reach a decent level you'll be able to also ship things to other platforms and more users. 

--
### Excellent for creative people

The web has a ton of resources and packages, that allow creative people to be [[Zettelkasten/Creative Developer\|creative developers]] and create amazing things **all by them selves**. This alongside [[Zettelkasten/Artificial Intelligence MOC\|AI]] will blur the boundary between creative designers and developers.

--
### Freelancing

As many other tech-related professions you'll have the opportunity to be a **freelancer**. The benefit that web development has is that you can offer to any medium-small business as **more people need a website than an app**.

--
### Multi-platform

The web allows you to access your app to **all platforms** regarding their OS and spects, and with evolving technologies like More Browser APIs, Responsive and PWAs designs you can build a pretty feature-complete app with just web technologies

#### Super multi-platform
Besides the ability to run a web app anywhere you can also create **native apps** with [[React Native\|React Native]] that enables you to create a native app. See [[Multiplatform Development\|Multiplatform Development]] for more info.

## Reasons to consider other alternatives

--
### Competitive  and Saturated Market

The web development market can be quite competitive as the entry level can get low, so, you'll find yourself competing against a more people for a position or projects, along that, there are [[Tools to create websites \|Tools to create websites ]] that makes the environment more competitive.

> But at the end someone has to do the job, right?

--
### Rapid technology change

The web ecosystem is always changing an evolving, this can get quite overwhelming for some people that have this as a hobby or have other activities.

--
### Average less pay

Although all tech-related jobs are well paid on **AVERAGE** web development is one of the ones that pays less, but this can vary depending on the complexity of the project, the client and even the [location](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-salary-salary-by-developer-type). So if you're looking for the highest-income job you might want to think about other options

--
### Create a native app

If you have no coding skills but want to learn to create an idea that you have it might be worth investigating if **is doable** with web development tools, specially if you're looking to use platform-specific features, like: 

- Widgets
- App clips
- Watch / WearOS apps
