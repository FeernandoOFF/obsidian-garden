# Internet

### What is the Internet
> TL;DR The internet is the physical layer that allows a device connect to each other via wire connection, wireless trough a local network or to the other side of the world with ISP and underwater cables.

The internet refers to a global network of **interconnected computers and devices** that enables the **exchange of information** and communication through a **standardized set of protocols**. It allows users to access a wide range of services, like the [[Zettelkasten/World Wide Web\|Web]], [[Zettelkasten/Internet of Things MOC\|IoT]] and many other inter-connected interactions between devices.


### History
The development of the internet can be traced back to the 1960s, when the United States Department of Defense created ARPANET, a precursor to the modern internet. Since then, the internet has undergone significant advancements and has become more accessible to the general public, leading to the widespread adoption of its technology.

#### Internet Infrastructure
The internet relies on a complex infrastructure of physical networks, data centers, and servers to function. This includes undersea cables, satellite networks, and wireless connections. 
#### Internet Protocols

Protocols, such as TCP/IP, govern the flow and exchange of data on the internet. These protocols are constantly evolving, and new ones are being developed to improve the efficiency and security of internet communication.
