# Flux Architecture


The reason Flux is more commonly associated with web development is partly due to its origins at Facebook, where it was initially developed for managing complex web applications. However, the principles of unidirectional data flow and separation of concerns offered by Flux are equally applicable to app development, and variations of Flux can be used to manage state in mobile or desktop applications.
