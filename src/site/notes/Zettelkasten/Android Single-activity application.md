# Android Single-activity application

Pretty much like [[SPA\|SPA]]s in web, Single activities applications involve changing UI components at runtime, making the app feel faster and code more reusable

### Benefits:

1.	Simplicity: Having a single main activity simplifies the application structure and reduces complexity. It makes it easier to manage and navigate between different screens or views within the same activity.
2.	Improved Performance: Switching between activities can incur overhead in terms of memory and CPU usage. With a single-activity architecture, you can avoid this overhead and improve the overall performance of your application.
3.	Modularization: By using fragments or views within the main activity, you can modularize different parts of your application and reuse them across multiple screens. This leads to more efficient code reuse and maintenance.
4.	Shared Resources: Since all screens or views are within the same activity, they can easily access and share common resources such as data models, preferences, or dependencies.
### Drawbacks:
1.	Complexity of Maintenance: As the application grows and more screens or views are added to the main activity, it can become more challenging to maintain and understand the codebase. The complexity may increase if the logic for different screens becomes tightly coupled within a single activity.
2.	Limited Parallelism: Since all screens or views reside within the same activity, performing parallel or background tasks can be more difficult. It requires careful handling to ensure smooth user experience and avoid blocking the main thread.
3.	Code Organization: With multiple screens or views within the main activity, organizing and structuring the code can become more complex. Developers need to carefully manage the separation of concerns and maintain a clean code structure.
4.	Navigation Complexity: Navigating between different screens or views within the main activity may require additional logic and management compared to separate activities. Proper handling of back navigation and maintaining the application state can be more challenging.
