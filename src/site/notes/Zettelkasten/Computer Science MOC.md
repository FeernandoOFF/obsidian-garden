# Map of Contents:  Computer Science 


The primary purpose of this note is to  organise and categorise my knowledge into sections, assigning specific topics to each section, so that I am able to easily identify and share information as needed. 

For this Map of content I've taken the  [CS2023](https://csed.acm.org/knowledge-areas/) curriculum and split it into **practical** and **theoretical**, as one of my main [[Zettelkasten/My problem with school\|issues with the escolar system]] is that you follow a path without really knowing when you'll be able to apply it and if you really like it.


> [!note]- If you're looking to **create** something
> If you're looking to get things moving ASP. You should have a look at [DIY in Tech](DIY%20in%20Tech)

## Introduction


•	Overview of computer science as a field of study
•	Historical developments and evolution of computing
- [[Zettelkasten/Why Technology is important\|Why Technology is important]]
- [[Advantages and benefits of technological advancements\|Advantages and benefits of technological advancements]]

## Theoretical

> These are the foundation an will greatly help you to move with ease between projects and have a general understanding of how the modern computation really works. Think of this section of the **why**.

## Practical 

> This section is where you can have an overview of the actual technologies and abstractions that as developers use on our daily basis, most likely you'll have a bird's eye around everything and then choose a specialisation. Think of this as the **How** we create things.
