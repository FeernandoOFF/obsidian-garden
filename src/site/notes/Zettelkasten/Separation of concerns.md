# Separation of concerns

## What is Separation of concerns pricniple?

The **most important** principle to follow is this separation of concerns. A common mistake is to have all the logic inside a UI Element (like a `React Component`, `Android Activity/Fragment` or an `iOS View`), these UI elements should **only contain UI-related logic** and bind user interaction to the state holders that then will update the data that the UI shows to the user.
