## The importance of Informatics


In this "blog" I'll focus on informatics and a little bit of electronics, mainly because is my area (hehe) but also there're some points that make the them so interesting and so important.

- First and most important is that, now days **every one interacts with a computer in some way**.  And It's vital that everyone has an idea what happens underneath. 

- Secondly is their scalability; You can build almost whatever you want and if it results a great business Idea (See [[startups\|startups]]) you can easily scale them, Outside the Economic part it also can be shared to help other people.

- Accessibility related to the point that everyone interacts with a computer somehow, is easily accessible and you can start right now while you're reading this. 

- And finally, **You only need your brain** to make it work!
