# Software comparisons

In this note I list software that I've tried as a reminder for me in the future to know why I choose to adopt them into [[Zettelkasten/My digital environment\|My digital environment]]

## Ecosystems

I've created a full note about this as I think it is something to take on mind when faced with options [[Zettelkasten/Ecosystem Comparison\|Ecosystem Comparison]]

## Code Editors

> For code Editors I've decided to go with all the JetBrains IDEs for big projects and portability of settings and vim motions and NeoVim for a super-fast edits and to connect to servers trough SSH.

## Note-taking apps

> For notes I have two requirements: No platform lock-in and offline-first. This leads me to Obsidian and LogSeq. So far for maturity I've choosen Obsidian but I don't like the fact that it is not open-sourced at some point I'd like to migrate to LogSeq, but as they share the markdown approach there's no hurry.

> For project-management and freelance related stuff I'm planning to use Notion and allow people to access it.
