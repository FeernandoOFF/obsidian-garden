# Dependency Inversion


### What is Dependency Inversion principle?

It means that dependencies should always go in **one direction only:** from high-level components with the business rules and entities through the interfaces to the low-level components like frameworks and databases. In practical terms: **no business logic should ever be dependent on technical implementation and its frameworks**, databases, interface, or anything else.
