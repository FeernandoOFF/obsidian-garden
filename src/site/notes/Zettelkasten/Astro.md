# ASTRO

## What is astro?
Astro is a [[Framework\|Framework]] to build **static sites**. The interesting part is how easy it becomes to create static sites from different data sources, such as [[Zettelkasten/API\|API]]s, [[Zettelkasten/Markdown\|Markdown]] and MDX. And also the superpower of integrating **different frontend frameworks** and Libraries into the **same project** 

> Personally I'd use astro to create regular sites and even e-commerce websites that are content-heavy
